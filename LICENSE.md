1. Definitions

Engine
The OriginSTANDARD Engine, including but not limited to the Glow + Seal mechanism, invariant rules, signing logic, issuance workflow, timing ladders, truth-window enforcement, and any associated cryptographic processes.

Verifier
Any software that validates OriginSTANDARD outputs strictly according to the published OriginSTANDARD verification specification without modification, extension, or interpretation.

Standard Output
Any artifact (including but not limited to media, documents, data, or logs) that contains a valid OriginSTANDARD Glow + Seal and passes verification as PASS under the official specification.

Truth Window
A cryptographically enforced confirmation window requiring provable human presence and hardware-attested confirmation bound to a specific action, render model, and receipt.

You / Licensee
Any individual or legal entity that accesses, uses, distributes, references, or builds software, systems, or services related to OriginSTANDARD.

⸻

2. Ownership

All right, title, and interest in the OriginSTANDARD Engine, including issuance authority, signing keys, invariant rules, timing policy, truth-window enforcement, and economic controls, remain exclusively with Origin Standard LLC.

This license grants no ownership, no implied rights, and no transfer of authority.

⸻

3. Permitted Use

3.1 Verifier Use (Free, Irrevocable, Permissionless)

You may:
	•	Build, distribute, and operate verifiers
	•	Verify OriginSTANDARD Standard Outputs offline or online
	•	Publish verification results strictly as PASS, FAIL, or INVALID

Provided that all of the following conditions are met:
	•	The verifier follows the published specification exactly
	•	No additional logic, interpretation, scoring, heuristics, or probabilistic judgment is added
	•	Output discipline is preserved
	•	Verification does not claim truth, value, legality, ownership, or intent

Verification is public and permissionless.

⸻

3.2 Engine Use (Licensed Only)

You may not, without an explicit written commercial license from Origin Standard LLC:
	•	Operate the OriginSTANDARD Engine
	•	Generate or issue Glow + Seal outputs
	•	Sign receipts or manifests
	•	Exercise issuance authority
	•	Represent yourself as an OriginSTANDARD issuer

No exception exists.

⸻

4. Prohibited Actions

The following actions are expressly prohibited:
	•	Attempting to recreate, clone, emulate, or simulate the OriginSTANDARD Engine
	•	Issuing “compatible”, “alternative”, or “equivalent” Glow/Seal formats
	•	Modifying invariant rules while claiming OriginSTANDARD compliance
	•	Using the specification to build a competing issuance or authenticity system
	•	Representing unsigned, self-signed, or third-party outputs as OriginSTANDARD
	•	Producing outputs intended to be interpreted as OriginSTANDARD Standard Output without authorization

Functional similarity does not grant legitimacy.

Any violation immediately voids all rights granted under this license.

⸻

5. Non-Adaptation Clause (Hard Freeze)

The OriginSTANDARD specification is frozen by design.

Licensees may not:
	•	Extend
	•	Adapt
	•	Reinterpret
	•	Improve
	•	Soft-fork
	•	Partially implement

the Engine semantics while retaining the OriginSTANDARD name or claim.

Compatibility means exact conformance, not intent.

Any deviation constitutes a fork and must not reference OriginSTANDARD.

⸻

6. Signature Authority

Only cryptographic keys issued by Origin Standard LLC constitute valid signing authority.

Possession of:
	•	the specification,
	•	a verifier,
	•	the source code,
	•	or the documentation

does not grant issuance rights.

No exception. No delegation. No derived authority.

⸻

7. Truth Window Enforcement

High-Value actions require a valid Truth Window receipt.

High-Value actions are deterministically defined as any action whose irreversible impact exceeds predefined financial, legal, identity, or authority thresholds enforced by the Engine.

Truth Window receipts are:
	•	Mandatory where required by policy
	•	Single-use
	•	Non-replayable
	•	Cryptographically bound to the specific action, render model, and receipt
	•	Required to be rendered outside the authority of the requesting application or operating system

Absence, reuse, or substitution of a Truth Window receipt results in INVALID.

⸻

8. No Warranty

The software, specification, and documentation are provided “AS IS”.

Origin Standard LLC disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

Verification asserts only conformance, never truth or value.

⸻

9. Termination

Any breach of this license immediately terminates all rights granted herein.

Termination does not affect:
	•	Previously verified Standard Outputs
	•	Public verification rights

⸻

10. Governing Principle

Verification is public.
Issuance is sovereign.
Truth is not negotiable.
